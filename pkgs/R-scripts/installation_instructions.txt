You will need to install the R packages "maps" and "mapdata", and the 
ISgeometry package. There are many alternative ways to do the 
installation, but the following should work independently of your OS.

0. If you are a Windows user, you will need to install also the 
Rtools-package from http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/lang/CRAN/

1. In R command line, give the following command to install the packages 
"maps" and "mapdata":

> install.packages(pkgs=c('maps','mapdata'),dependencies=TRUE)


2. Then install the ISegoemetry packge:

> install.packages(pkgs='ISgeometry4CH.tgz',repos=NULL,type='source')

3. You will then need to load the necesary packages with

> require(ISgeometry)

which will automatically load all the pakages it depends on as well.
